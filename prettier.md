# What is Prettier

Prettier is a code formatter, which means it will format your code - make it more readable and easier for you and other people to understand it.

# Why and how should you use Prettier?

First of all, formatting and commenting code is not actually needed for a function to work. Machines such as browsers are perfectly capable of reading and executing it without. A computer doesn’t care if the code looks pretty as long as it’s correct and doesn’t produce errors.

You know who does care about code formatting and comments? Humans. People like you and me who need to read, understand, and modify code from time to time. It’s much easier if you have proper formatting and that make the code easier to understand. Not using formatting in code is equivalent to not using formatting in writing. You wouldn’t read this post either if I did away with all the paragraphs and headings, no matter how good the content is otherwise.

This code, for example, will work because the synax is correct. But it's ugly, and quite hard for you and me to understand.

To fix it, just use Prettier! Prettier is one of many code-formatting extensions that with one simple command, will make your code look much better.

On Windows: Alt + Shift + F.  
On Mac Shift + Option + F.  
On Linux Ctrl + Shift + I.  

This is the outcome:

# How to install Prettier

By now, you should already have Visual Studio Code installed on your computer. The next step is to go to the extensions tab on your workspace, as shown in the image below:

After a few seconds, you should have Prettier installed, and you're ready to make your code, well, prettier.

You also can set-up Pretter so that it auto-formats when you save the file. To complete that setup, in your VS Code settings, search for "format" and choose "format on save".

Next, in the VS Code settings, serach for "default formatter" and make sure to choose Prettier as your default formatter.
