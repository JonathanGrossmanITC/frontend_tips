After a few seconds, you shohuld have Prettier installed, and you're ready to make your code, well, prettier.

# Why and how should you use Prettier?

First of all, formatting and commenting code is not actually needed for a function to work.
Machines such as browsers are perfectly capable of reading and executing it without.
A computer doesn’t care if the code looks pretty as long as it’s correct and doesn’t produce errors.
Yet, you know who does care about code formatting and comments? Humans. People like you and me who need to read, understand, and modify code from time to time.
In those instances, it’s much easier if you have proper formatting and/or comments that make the code easier to understand. Not using formatting in code is equivalent to not using formatting in writing. You wouldn’t read this post either if I did away with all the paragraphs and headings, no matter how good the content is otherwise.

This code, for example, will work, but it's ugly, and quite hard to understand.

To fix it, just use Prettier!
Prettier is one of many code-formatting extensions that with one simple command, will make your code look much better.

On Windows: Alt + Shift + F
On Mac Shift + Option + F.
On Linux Ctrl + Shift + I.

This is the outcome:
